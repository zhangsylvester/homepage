                "Rowmotion Orbits of Trapezoid Posets." (with Quang Vu Dao, Julian Wellman and Calvin Yost-Wolff.)

                </summary>
                <p>Rowmotion is an invertible operator on the order ideals of a poset which has been extensively studied and is well understood for the rectangle poset. In this paper, we show that rowmotion is equivariant with respect to a bijection of Hamaker, Patrias, Pechenik and Williams between order ideals of rectangle and trapezoid posets, thereby affirming a conjecture of Hopkins that the rectangle and trapezoid posets have the same rowmotion orbit structures. Our main tools in proving this are $K$-jeu-de-taquin and (weak) $K$-Knuth equivalence of increasing tableaux. We define <i>almost minimal tableaux</i> as a family of tableaux naturally arising from order ideals and show for any $\lambda$, the almost minimal tableaux of shape $\lambda$ are in different (weak) $K$-Knuth equivalence classes. We also discuss and make some progress on related conjectures of Hopkins on down-degree homomesy.

                <summary >"Arborescences of Covering Graphs." (with Sunita Chepuri, CJ Dowd, Andy Hardt, Gregory Michel, and Valerie Zhang.)
		<br><span><i>arXiv preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01060">arXiv:1912.01060</a></i> (2019)</span>
                </summary>
                <p>An <i>arborescence</i> of a directed graph $\Gamma$ is a spanning tree directed toward a particular vertex $v$. The arborescences of a graph rooted at a particular vertex may be encoded as a polynomial $A_v(\Gamma)$ representing the sum of the weights of all such arborescences. The arborescences of a graph and the arborescences of a covering graph $\tilde{\Gamma}$ are closely related. Using <i>voltage graphs</i> to construct arbitrary regular covers, we derive a novel explicit formula for the ratio of $A_v(\Gamma)$ to the sum of arborescences in the lift $A_{\tilde{v}}(\tilde{\Gamma})$ in terms of the determinant of Chaiken's voltage Laplacian matrix, a generalization of the Laplacian matrix. Chaiken's results on the relationship between the voltage Laplacian and vector fields on $\Gamma$ are reviewed, and we provide a new proof of Chaiken's results via a deletion-contraction argument.
